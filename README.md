# wXyEngine

### Description
A simple 2D game engine written in Python using Moderngl

It derives from my master thesis project.
It is currently in development and not ready for use.

### Structure

this engine is structured following JoltPhysics engine structure

https://github.com/jrouwe/JoltPhysics/tree/master/Jolt

The engine is divided into several modules:
- **Geometry**: contains the geometry classes of the engine
- **Physics**: contains the physics classes of the engine
- **Rendering**: contains the rendering classes of the engine

## TODO
- [ ] Add a proper README.md
- [ ] Rename class and submodule names to be more consistent
